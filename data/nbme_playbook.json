  "commonTraps": [
    "- Wrong priority: insulin before fluids in DKA; antihistamines before epinephrine in anaphylaxis; imaging before decompression in tension pneumothorax",
    "- Wrong timing: IgA nephropathy (during infection) vs PSGN (weeks later)",
    "- Wrong physiology: serum hyperkalemia in DKA may reflect shift, not total-body excess",
    "- Wrong site of care: neonates and unstable patients often require broader evaluation and higher-acuity management",
    "- Normal variant vs pathology: common in pediatrics (development, sleep, newborn transitional findings)"

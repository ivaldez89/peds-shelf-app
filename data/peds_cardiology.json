      "question": "What is the diagnosis?",
      "answer": "Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)",
      "explanation": "The continuous 'machinery' murmur, bounding pulses (from diastolic runoff into low-resistance pulmonary bed), and wide pulse pressure (elevated systolic, decreased diastolic) are pathognomonic for PDA. Maternal rubella infection is a classic risk factor (congenital rubella syndrome can include PDA, pulmonary stenosis, cataracts, deafness). In full-term infants, indomethacin or ibuprofen is used to close the PDA. In premature infants on positive pressure ventilation, the PDA may be tolerated. If pharmacologic closure fails, surgical ligation is an option.",

On exam, he is cyanotic (SpO2 80-85%), has tachypnea, and a loud P2. CXR shows dilated pulmonary arteries. Echocardiography demonstrates severe pulmonary hypertension with bidirectional shunting across the remaining ASD. Mixed venous O2 sat is 60%.",
      "question": "What life-threatening condition has likely developed, and what is contraindicated?",
      "answer": "Eisenmenger syndrome (reversal of left-to-right shunt to right-to-left due to pulmonary vascular disease); surgical repair of the defect is contraindicated",
      "explanation": "Eisenmenger syndrome develops from chronic left-to-right shunting causing pulmonary vascular disease. Once pulmonary vascular resistance equals or exceeds systemic resistance, the shunt reverses to right-to-left → cyanosis develops/worsens. This is irreversible and likely in uncorrected large shunts or inadequately repaired defects. Once Eisenmenger is established, surgical closure of the defect is contraindicated because the right-to-left shunt is necessary for survival (to decompress the RV). Medical management includes oxygen, diuretics, digoxin, prostacyclins (epoprostenol, sildenafil), heart-lung transplantation in severe cases. Hemoptysis is from pulmonary infarction. Pregnancy is contraindicated (high maternal mortality).",

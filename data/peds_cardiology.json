Maternal rubella infection is a classic risk factor (congenital rubella syndrome can include PDA, pulmonary stenosis, cataracts, deafness).

Once pulmonary vascular resistance equals or exceeds systemic resistance, the shunt reverses to right-to-left \u2192 cyanosis develops/worsens. This is irreversible and likely in uncorrected large shunts or inadequately repaired defects. Once Eisenmenger is established, surgical closure of the defect is contraindicated because the right-to-left shunt is necessary for survival (to decompress the RV). Medical management includes oxygen, diuretics, digoxin, prostacyclins (epoprostenol, sildenafil), heart-lung transplantation in severe cases. Hemoptysis is from pulmonary infarction.
